abstract: Scale-wise evaluation of object detectors is important for real-world applications. However, existing metrics are either coarse or not sufficiently reliable. In this paper, we propose novel scale-wise metrics that strike a balance between fineness and reliability, using a filter bank consisting of triangular and trapezoidal band-pass filters. We conduct experiments with two methods on two datasets and show that the proposed metrics can highlight the differences between the methods and between the datasets.
