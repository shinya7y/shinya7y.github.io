abstract: We present a novel approach to generate emissive textures for luminous objects, using direct 3D supervision from a 3D model dataset. To this end, we construct Emissive Objaverse, a dataset based on the recently proposed Objaverse dataset, and propose 3D Lighter, a method using neural fields with generative latent optimization.
